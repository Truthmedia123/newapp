## Conclusion

Your Cloudflare setup has been successfully restored with the exception of the manual dashboard configuration steps. The frontend is deployed, the database is initialized with all required tables, and the API functions are in place. 

The latest deployment (0ca730b5) has been created from your new git commit (c760bb3), and you've now set up the configuration files needed for automatic Git deployments. However, **automatic Git deployment is NOT YET ACTIVE** and requires manual setup through the Cloudflare dashboard.

Once you complete all the manual steps in the Cloudflare dashboard, including the Git integration, your site should be fully functional at https://weddingreplit.pages.dev with automatic deployments enabled. Until then, you'll need to manually deploy using the `wrangler pages deploy` command.

If you encounter any issues after completing the manual steps, refer to the troubleshooting sections in the documentation files or contact Cloudflare support for platform-specific issues.
