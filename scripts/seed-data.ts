## The Dekhri Ritual
In this ritual, the groom's sister-in-law (saal) welcomes the bride to her new home by performing an aarti and applying a red sindoor dot on her forehead.

## Traditional Attire
Brides typically wear a saree in traditional Goan colors like red, green, or purple, while grooms wear a white shirt with a dhoti and a stole.

## Choosing the Right Beach
Each beach in Goa has its own character. Baga and Calangute are popular for their amenities, while Palolem and Agonda offer more privacy and serenity.

## Vendor Selection
Work with local vendors who understand the unique challenges of beach weddings, such as wind, sand, and tides.`
