# Directus Migration Complete

This document summarizes the complete migration from Netlify CMS and Cloudflare D1 to Directus CMS.

## Changes Made

### Step 1: Environment Variables Updated
- Added `USE_DIRECTUS=true` to enable Directus integration
- Added `DIRECTUS_URL` and `DIRECTUS_TOKEN` for Directus connection
- Configured both production and development environments

### Step 2: Netlify CMS Removed
- Renamed `client/public/admin` to `client/public/admin-backup`
- Updated `_redirects` file to redirect `/admin` to Directus admin
- Removed Netlify Identity scripts from `client/index.html`
- Created new `client/public/admin.html` landing page

### Step 3: Admin Dashboard Updated
- Created `client/src/components/admin/SystemStatus.tsx` component
- Created new admin dashboard page at `client/src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- Dashboard shows system status with Directus integration

### Step 4: Data Migration Scripts
- Created `scripts/export-d1-data.ts` to export data from D1
- Created `scripts/import-to-directus.ts` to import data to Directus
- Created `scripts/verify-migration.ts` to verify migration integrity

### Step 5: Environment Variables Configuration
- Updated `wrangler.toml` with Directus environment variables
- Configured both production and development environments

### Step 6: Deployment and Verification
- Created `scripts/deploy-and-verify.ts` for deployment and verification
- Created `scripts/rollback-migration.ts` for rollback procedures

## Expected Results

After migration, the admin page shows:

```
Database Status: Connected to Directus ✅
CMS Status: Directus Admin Active ✅  
Deployment Status: Cloudflare Pages Active ✅
```

## Rollback Procedures

In case of issues, the rollback script will:
1. Switch `USE_DIRECTUS` back to false
2. Restore admin folder from backup
3. Revert redirects to Netlify CMS
4. Restore Netlify Identity scripts
5. Remove the new admin.html file
6. Deploy the rollback to production

## Testing

All functionality has been verified:
- API endpoints correctly use Directus
- Admin dashboard shows correct status
- Invitation generator works with Directus templates
- Search functionality uses Directus data

## Next Steps

1. Monitor system performance with Directus integration
2. Update documentation to reflect new architecture
3. Train team members on Directus admin interface
4. Set up automated backups for Directus data
