# First Build Trigger

This file is created to trigger the first build and deployment to Cloudflare Pages.

The build should automatically start when this commit is pushed to the repository, as Cloudflare Pages is connected to the GitHub repository and configured to build on pushes to the main branch.

## What to Expect

1. After pushing this commit, Cloudflare will automatically start building the project
2. The build process will run `npm run build:production`
3. The output will be deployed to Cloudflare Pages
4. You should be able to access the site at your configured domain once deployment is complete

## Verification Steps

1. Check the GitHub Actions tab to see the deployment workflow running
2. Monitor the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for build progress
3. Once complete, visit your domain to verify the site is live
