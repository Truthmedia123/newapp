## Remaining Steps

### 1. ⚠️ Database Binding (Critical)
You need to bind the D1 database to your Pages project in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Go to the Cloudflare dashboard
2. Navigate to Pages > weddingreplit > Settings > Functions
3. Under "D1 Database Bindings", add:
   - Variable name: `DB`
   - Database: Select `wedding_platform_db`

### 2. ⚠️ Environment Variables
Set these environment variables in the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. Go to Pages > weddingreplit > Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add:
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
   - `SITE_URL` = `https://weddingreplit.pages.dev`

### 3. ⚠️ Custom Domain (Optional)
To use your custom domain:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to Pages > weddingreplit > Custom Domains
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Enter `thegoanwedding.com`
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Testing Your Deployment

### Frontend
- Visit your site at: https://weddingreplit.pages.dev

# List databases
npx wrangler d1 list

# Execute schema updates
npx wrangler d1 execute wedding_platform_db --file=./schema.sql

# Run SQL commands

# View logs
npx wrangler pages deployment tail --project-name=weddingreplit
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**: Ensure the D1 database is properly bound in the Cloudflare dashboard.

2. **Environment Variables Not Found**: Check that all required environment variables are set in the Pages project settings.

3. **API Endpoints Not Working**: Verify that the Functions directory structure is correct and that the files export the proper `onRequest` functions.

4. **Redirect Issues**: Ensure the `_redirects` file is in the `client/public` directory and gets included in the build.
