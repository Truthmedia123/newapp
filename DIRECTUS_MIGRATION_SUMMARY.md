- **After**: Directus only as the single source of truth for all content

### 2. API Architecture
- **Before**: Mixed custom API routes and Directus API
- **After**: Directus API exclusively for content management, custom routes only for application-specific functionality

### 3. Development Workflow
- **Before**: Multiple CMS options with complex configuration
- **After**: Simplified workflow with Directus as the sole CMS

### 4. Deployment
- **Before**: Supported Netlify deployment
- **After**: Cloudflare Pages deployment with Directus integration

## Benefits Achieved
