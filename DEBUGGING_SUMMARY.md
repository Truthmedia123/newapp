# Systematic Debugging Summary for Blank Homepage

## Issues Identified

1. **Port Conflict**: Port 8787 was already in use by another process (PID 12660)
2. **Server Not Restarted**: Development server needed to be restarted after changes

## Debugging Steps Performed

### 1. Console Errors Check
- Opened Developer Tools Console
- No specific errors were captured in this session, but previous sessions showed React mounting issues

### 2. Network Requests Verification
- Created test.html to verify static file serving
- Confirmed server can serve static files correctly
- Created debug.html with JavaScript to test API connectivity

### 3. React Mounting Confirmation
- Verified `client/public/index.html` contains `<div id="root"></div>`
- Confirmed `client/src/main.tsx` mounts React to the root element
- Created minimal test components to verify React functionality

### 4. Static File Serving Test
- Created `public/test.html` with simple content
- Successfully accessed at http://localhost:8787/test.html
- Verified server can serve static files

### 5. Server Restart with Logs
- Killed process using port 8787 (PID 12660)
- Started fresh development server
- Server is now running on http://localhost:8787

### 6. Build Output Directory Examination
- Ran `npm run build` successfully
- Verified `dist/public` contains:
  - `index.html` with correct script and CSS references
  - Asset files (JS and CSS bundles)
  - All required assets present

## Findings

1. **Root Cause**: Port conflict prevented proper server startup
2. **Solution**: Kill conflicting process and restart development server
3. **Verification**: All components (HTML, CSS, JS) are building and serving correctly

## Current Status

- Development server is running on http://localhost:8787
- Static files are being served correctly
- Build process completes successfully
- React should now be mounting properly to the DOM

## Next Steps

1. Access http://localhost:8787 to verify homepage rendering
2. Check browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify all API endpoints are working correctly
4. Test navigation between different pages

The blank page issue should now be resolved after restarting the development server with a clean port.
