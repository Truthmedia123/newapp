## Implementation Details

### Invitation Editor (`/invitations`)

- Integrates with Directus invitation_templates collection
- Allows text editing with color picker and font controls
- Saves completed invitations back to Directus

- Provides instant autocomplete search for vendors
- Includes filtering by category and location
- Uses debounced search queries for performance

### Vendor Availability Tracker (`/vendor-availability`)
- Shows real-time vendor availability updates

- Shows availability calendar information

## Redirect Rules

The application uses the following redirect rules to support client-side routing:

```
# Admin redirect to Directus
/admin  https://your-directus-instance.railway.app/admin  302

# SPA fallback - must be last
/*                    /index.html                200
```

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production" for Cloudflare deployment
- `SITE_URL`: The base URL of the deployed application

2. Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed
3. Ensure environment variables are properly configured
4. Check the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for deployment status

## Future Improvements

1. Optimize bundle size to reduce load times
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
