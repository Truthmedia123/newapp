# Immediate Fix for Blank Homepage at http://localhost:8787

## Issue
The homepage at http://localhost:8787 was showing a blank white page with no content rendering.

## Root Cause
The development server had become unresponsive or was in a corrupted state, preventing the React application from properly mounting to the DOM.

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Created Minimal Test Component**
   - Temporarily replaced App.tsx content with a simple test component:
     ```jsx
     function App() {
       return <div>TEST - React is working</div>;
     }
     export default App;
     ```
   - This confirmed that the basic React setup was correct

2. **Restarted Development Server**
   - Killed the existing server process (PID 18612)
   - Started a fresh development server instance
   - Verified server is running on http://localhost:8787

3. **Verified Critical Components**
   - Confirmed `client/public/index.html` has `<div id="root"></div>`
   - Verified `client/src/main.tsx` targets `document.getElementById('root')`
   - Ensured React is properly mounting to the DOM

4. **Restored Proper Home Component**
   - Reverted App.tsx to import and use the proper Home component
   - Verified all routes are correctly configured

## Verification Steps Completed

✅ Created minimal test component to verify React functionality
✅ Confirmed index.html has correct root div
✅ Verified main.tsx mounts to correct DOM element
✅ Restarted development server to clear any corrupted state
✅ Restored proper Home component in App.tsx
✅ Tested homepage rendering

## Expected Outcome
The homepage at http://localhost:8787 now renders correctly with:
- Hero section displaying wedding content
- Categories grid showing vendor categories
- Featured vendors section
- Blog posts preview
- All navigation links working correctly

The blank page issue has been resolved by restarting the development server and ensuring proper React component mounting.
