# Dependency Updates and Security Fixes

## Summary

This document outlines the dependency updates and security fixes applied to the wedding website project to address vulnerabilities and improve stability.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Vulnerabilities in esbuild**: The project had moderate severity vulnerabilities related to esbuild versions <= 0.24.2
2. **Outdated drizzle-kit**: The project was using an older version of drizzle-kit with known vulnerabilities
3. **Damaged lockfile**: The npm lockfile was reported as invalid or damaged

## Changes Made

### Dependency Updates

1. **Updated drizzle-kit**:
   - From vulnerable versions to `^0.31.4`
   - This addresses the esbuild vulnerability issues

2. **Updated Vite**:
   - From older versions to `^7.1.7`
   - This ensures compatibility with the latest features and security fixes

3. **Cleaned and Reinstalled Dependencies**:
   - Removed node_modules folder completely
   - Killed any running node processes that might be locking files
   - Reinstalled all dependencies with `npm install`

4. **Updated package-lock.json**:
   - Regenerated the lockfile to reflect current dependency versions
   - Ensured consistent dependency resolution

## Verification

1. **Build Process**: 
   - `npm run build:production` completes successfully
   - Vite builds the frontend assets correctly
   - Esbuild compiles the worker code without errors

2. **Development Server**:
   - `npm run pages:dev` starts successfully
   - Server runs on http://localhost:8787
   - Hot module replacement works correctly

3. **Security Audit**:
   - Vulnerabilities related to esbuild have been addressed
   - drizzle-kit is now using a secure version

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Deprecated Packages**:
   - `react-beautiful-dnd@13.1.1` is deprecated
   - Consider migrating to an alternative drag-and-drop library in the future

2. **Ongoing Maintenance**:
   - Regular security audits should be performed
   - Dependencies should be updated periodically
   - Monitor for new vulnerabilities in the dependency tree

## Commands for Future Maintenance

```bash
# Update dependencies to latest versions
npm update

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix security vulnerabilities (when available)
npm audit fix --force

# Regenerate lockfile
npm install --package-lock-only

# Clean install (if needed)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

This update ensures that the project is using secure, up-to-date dependencies and should provide a stable foundation for continued development.
