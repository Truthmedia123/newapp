# Domain Setup Complete

## Summary
Your wedding website project has been prepared for domain connection. Here's what has been done:

1. Updated `.env` file with HTTPS for SITE_URL
2. Created a comprehensive [DOMAIN_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md](file:///C:/Users/NOEL%20FERNANDES/Desktop/Old%20directory/weddingreplit/DOMAIN_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md) with step-by-step instructions
3. Verified that configuration files are ready for your custom domain

## Next Steps

To connect your actual domain, follow these steps:

### 1. Replace Placeholder Domains
In your configuration files, replace `https://thegoanwedding.com` with your actual domain:

- `.env` file
- `.env.production` file
- `wrangler.toml` file (in [env.production.vars] section)

### 2. Follow the Domain Connection Guide
Refer to [DOMAIN_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md](file:///C:/Users/NOEL%20FERNANDES/Desktop/Old%20directory/weddingreplit/DOMAIN_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on:
