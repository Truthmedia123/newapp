- Modify recent activity feed
- Customize quick actions
- Adjust styling

### Search Endpoint

- Add new endpoints

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying to production:

1. Ensure all extensions are built before deployment
2. Verify that the schema has been imported
3. Test all endpoints and dashboard functionality
4. Configure appropriate permissions for users
5. Set up monitoring for API performance

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Extensions not appearing**: Ensure they are built and the server is restarted
2. **API endpoints returning 404**: Check that the extension is properly registered
3. **Permission errors**: Verify user permissions for accessing collections
4. **Performance issues**: Consider adding database indexes for frequently queried fields

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding these extensions in the future:

1. **Booking Calendar Interface** - Custom interface for managing vendor bookings
2. **Review Moderation Panel** - Specialized tool for approving vendor reviews
3. **Vendor Portfolio Gallery** - Enhanced gallery interface for vendor images
4. **Package Builder** - Custom interface for creating vendor service packages
5. **Analytics Dashboard** - Advanced analytics for vendor performance metrics
