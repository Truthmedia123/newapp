# The Beautiful Tradition of Roce Ceremony in Goan Weddings

The Roce ceremony is one of the most cherished pre-wedding traditions in Goan Catholic culture, representing the formal announcement of the upcoming marriage and the blessing of the couple by their families and community. This beautiful ritual, steeped in centuries of tradition, continues to be an integral part of Goan weddings today.

The word "Roce" comes from the Portuguese word "rociada," meaning "to sprinkle." This ceremony typically takes place a few days before the wedding, usually on a Thursday or Saturday evening. It serves as both a blessing ritual and a joyous celebration that brings together both families and the broader community.
