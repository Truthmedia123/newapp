# TheGoanWedding Blank Page Issue Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. The homepage was loading a blank page instead of the main wedding platform interface
2. The `/api/vendors/featured` endpoint was missing from the development server
3. The App.tsx file was previously importing HomeSimple instead of Home component

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed App Routing Configuration
- Updated `client/src/App.tsx` to import the proper Home component:
  - Changed from `import Home from "@/pages/HomeSimple";` to `import Home from "@/pages/Home";`

### 2. Added Missing API Endpoint
- Added the missing `/api/vendors/featured` endpoint to `server/dev-server.ts`:
  - This endpoint filters vendors with `featured: 1` property from the mock database
  - Returns a list of featured vendors for the homepage to display

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling in Home Component
- Updated `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` with better error handling:
  - Added error states for API calls
  - Added logging for debugging purposes
  - Added error display for better user experience

### 4. Verified API Endpoints
- Confirmed that all required API endpoints are working correctly:
  - `/api/health` - Returns status OK
  - `/api/vendors` - Returns list of vendors
  - `/api/vendors/featured` - Returns list of featured vendors
  - `/api/blog` - Returns list of blog posts

## Expected Results
- The homepage now displays the full TheGoanWedding platform interface
- Proper navigation with Categories, Venues, Tools, Blog, etc. is visible
- Hero section with wedding content is displayed
- Vendor categories and featured vendors are shown
- Blog posts are displayed in the blog preview section

## Verification Steps
1. Access the application at http://localhost:8787
2. Verify that the homepage loads correctly with all sections
3. Check that vendor categories are displayed
4. Confirm that featured vendors are shown
5. Verify that blog posts appear in the preview section
6. Test navigation to other pages

## Additional Notes
- The development server is running on http://localhost:8787
- Hot reload is active for development
- All API endpoints are functioning correctly
- The React application is properly rendering components
