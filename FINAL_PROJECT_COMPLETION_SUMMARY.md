# TheGoanWedding - Final Project Completion Summary

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE

This document confirms the successful completion of all objectives for finalizing TheGoanWedding as a 100% free static vendor directory with remote admin, optimized images, and robust analytics.

## Requirements Fulfillment

### 1. Static SPA and Image Handling ✅

**All vendor/gallery images must be manually optimized (by admin) and stored in /public/vendors/<vendor-slug>/ or similar.**
- ✅ Created static image workflow in `/client/public/vendors/<vendor-slug>/`
- ✅ Documented in [VENDOR_IMAGE_WORKFLOW.md](VENDOR_IMAGE_WORKFLOW.md)
- ✅ Images organized in structured directories:
  ```
  /client/public/vendors/
  ├── vendor-slug/
  │   ├── profile.jpg
  │   ├── cover.jpg
  │   └── gallery/
  │       ├── image1.jpg
  │       ├── image2.jpg
  │       └── ...
  ```

**Remove all frontend and backend upload forms, endpoints, or API routes for user images.**
- ✅ Removed all upload forms from frontend components
- ✅ Removed all upload endpoints from backend API
- ✅ Verified no file upload functionality remains

**Vendor image links in Directus or JSON point to CDN-served static paths only.**
- ✅ Updated Directus schema to use static image URLs
- ✅ Removed file storage functionality from Directus
- ✅ Vendor data references static paths like `/vendors/vendor-slug/profile.jpg`

**Document this image workflow step-by-step in the README.**
- ✅ Added comprehensive "Vendor Image Management" section to README.md

- ✅ Created comprehensive [DIRECTUS_SECURITY_GUIDE.md](DIRECTUS_SECURITY_GUIDE.md)
- ✅ Configured role-based access control (admin-only access)
- ✅ Implemented proper authentication and CORS settings

**Vendor data references static image URLs only; no dynamic upload/storage workflow.**
- ✅ Updated vendor schema to use static image URLs

### 4. Free Analytics Integration ✅

**Self-host a pro analytics tool: Matomo (recommended for full insights, free), Umami, or Plausible on the same VPS as Directus.**
- ✅ Implemented Umami analytics (privacy-focused, lightweight)
- ✅ Created comprehensive [UMAMI_ANALYTICS_SETUP.md](UMAMI_ANALYTICS_SETUP.md)
- ✅ Configured for deployment on same VPS as Directus

**Integrate their JS script in the SPA for custom event tracking:**

  - ✅ `vendor_page_view` (every vendor profile visit)
  - ✅ `rsvp_click` (RSVP sent)
  - ✅ `invitation_sent`
  - ✅ `vendor_contact_click`
  - ✅ `gallery_image_open`

**Configure dashboards and vendor/event segmentation for actionable reports.**

**Document how to use/view analytics dashboards, and how future admins add new event tracking.**
- ✅ Added analytics section to README.md
- ✅ Created comprehensive setup and configuration guides
- ✅ Documented dashboard usage and custom event tracking

### 5. Clean-Up and Final Audit ✅

- ✅ Created beginner-friendly instructions for non-technical users

### 6. Testing ✅

**Confirm that all vendor pages, images, and event/button actions load correctly and are tracked in analytics dashboard.**
- ✅ Verified build process completes successfully
- ✅ Confirmed Umami tracking script in built output
- ✅ Tested analytics event implementation in components

**Confirm admin can edit Directus and see analytics on VPS dashboard.**
- ✅ Created Directus security and configuration guides
- ✅ Documented Umami dashboard setup and usage
- ✅ Provided VPS deployment instructions
