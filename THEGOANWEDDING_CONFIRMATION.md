## Step-by-Step Maintenance/Expansion Guide

### 1. Adding a Vendor

#### Image Preparation:
1. Admin optimizes images to web-friendly sizes:
   - Profile: 800x600px
   - Cover: 1200x400px
   - Gallery: 1200x800px
2. Compress images using tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh
3. Use descriptive filenames in lowercase with hyphens

#### Directory Setup:
```bash
mkdir client/public/vendors/{vendor-slug}
mkdir client/public/vendors/{vendor-slug}/gallery
```

#### Image Placement:
Place optimized images in the appropriate directories:
- `profile.jpg` - Main vendor profile image
- `cover.jpg` - Banner/cover image for vendor page
- Gallery images in the `gallery/` subdirectory

#### Directus CMS Update:
1. Access Directus admin panel at `https://your-vps-domain.com/admin`
2. Navigate to Vendors collection
3. Create or update vendor record with:
   - Profile Image: `/vendors/{vendor-slug}/profile.jpg`
   - Cover Image: `/vendors/{vendor-slug}/cover.jpg`
   - Gallery Images: JSON array of paths:
     ```json
     [
       "/vendors/{vendor-slug}/gallery/image1.jpg",
       "/vendors/{vendor-slug}/gallery/image2.jpg"
     ]
     ```

#### Deployment:
1. Commit and push changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add client/public/vendors/{vendor-slug}/
   git commit -m "Add images for {vendor-name}"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Wait for Cloudflare Pages automatic deployment
3. Verify images load correctly on live site

### 2. Monitoring Traffic & Engagement

#### Accessing Analytics Dashboard:
1. Navigate to Umami dashboard at `https://analytics.yourdomain.com`
2. Log in with admin credentials
3. Select "TheGoanWedding" website

#### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- **Total Page Views**: Overall site traffic
- **Vendor Page Views**: Individual vendor performance
- **Contact Clicks**: Lead generation effectiveness
- **RSVP Actions**: Event engagement
- **Invitation Sends**: Feature usage
- **Gallery Views**: Content engagement

#### Dashboard Segmentation:
- Filter by Vendor ID to see individual performance
- Segment by Vendor Category to identify trends
- Use date ranges to track performance over time
- Compare metrics before/after content updates

#### Documentation Updates:
When adding custom events or dashboards:
1. Update `UMAMI_ANALYTICS_SETUP.md` with new event configurations
2. Document dashboard changes in `UMAMI_DASHBOARD_SEGMENTATION.md`
3. Add notes to README if significant changes affect admin workflow

### 3. Managing Images & Content

#### Periodic Maintenance:
1. **Image Pruning**:
   - Quarterly review of vendor directories
   - Remove images for discontinued vendors
   - Archive old gallery images to separate storage

2. **Optimization Checks**:
   - Verify all images are properly compressed
   - Check file sizes (aim for <500KB per image)
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions

3. **Content Updates**:
   - All new uploads/changes follow admin workflow only
   - No user-generated content or uploads
   - Regular content audits through Directus CMS

### 4. Security Audits

#### Directus Security:
1. Confirm admin panel is password-protected
2. Review user roles and permissions in Directus
3. Ensure only Administrator role has write access
4. Verify Public role has read-only access to necessary collections

#### Configuration Review:
1. Check `DIRECTUS_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` for best practices
2. Review `directus-cms/config.production.js` for proper settings:
   - CORS configuration
   - Rate limiting
   - SSL enforcement
3. Update credentials regularly:
   - Admin passwords
   - Database passwords
   - API keys

#### System Updates:
1. Keep Directus updated to latest stable version
2. Update Umami analytics regularly
3. Apply security patches to VPS OS

### 5. Documentation for Future Admins

#### Essential Documentation:
- **README.md**: Main project overview and quick start guide
- **VENDOR_IMAGE_WORKFLOW.md**: Detailed image management process
- **UMAMI_ANALYTICS_SETUP.md**: Analytics installation and configuration
- **UMAMI_DASHBOARD_SEGMENTATION.md**: Dashboard customization guide
- **DIRECTUS_SECURITY_GUIDE.md**: Security best practices and maintenance

#### Documentation Updates:
1. Keep all guides up to date with current processes
2. Include screenshots/screencasts for complex procedures
3. Write in non-technical language for ease of understanding
4. Regular review and updates during maintenance cycles

#### Training New Admins:
1. Walk through each documentation file
2. Demonstrate key workflows (adding vendors, checking analytics)
3. Provide access credentials and security guidelines
4. Schedule regular review sessions

### 6. Expanding Features (Optional)

#### Advanced Analytics:
1. Add more Umami events for new interactions:
   ```javascript
   // In new component files
   if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window as any).umami) {
     (window as any).umami('new_event_name', { 
       property1: value1,
       property2: value2
     });
   }
   ```
2. Create new dashboard segments in Umami interface
3. Document new events in `UMAMI_ANALYTICS_SETUP.md`

#### New Interactions:
1. When adding new user interactions, implement tracking:
   ```javascript
   // Track button clicks, form submissions, etc.
   const handleNewInteraction = () => {
     // Original interaction logic
     // ...
     
     // Add analytics tracking
     if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window as any).umami) {
       (window as any).umami('interaction_name', { 
         relevant_property: value
       });
     }
   };
   ```
2. Update analytics documentation with new events
3. Create new dashboard metrics for tracking effectiveness
