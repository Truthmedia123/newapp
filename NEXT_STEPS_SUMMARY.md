# Next Steps Summary

Based on the analysis of your wedding website project, here are the essential next steps to complete your integration with GitHub, Cloudflare, and CMS:

## 1. Complete Cloudflare Pages Setup

### Action Required:
1. Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard at https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Navigate to Pages section
3. Create a new project or verify existing project named "thegoanwedding"
4. Connect the project to your GitHub repository (https://github.com/Truthmedia123/newapp.git)
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build:production`
   - Build output directory: `dist/public`
6. Add your custom domain: thegoanwedding.com
7. Follow Cloudflare's DNS setup instructions to point your domain to Cloudflare

## 2. Add Required GitHub Secrets

### Action Required:
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/Truthmedia123/newapp
2. Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Add these repository secrets:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token with Pages permissions
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub token (usually automatically provided)

## 3. Configure Cloudflare Pages Environment Variables

### Action Required:
1. In your Cloudflare Pages project settings
2. Add these environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
   - `SITE_URL`: `https://thegoanwedding.com`

## 4. Merge Current Branch to Main

### Action Required:
1. Complete your current work on the `setup-cloudflare-d1` branch
2. Push all changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Cloudflare D1 setup"
   git push origin setup-cloudflare-d1
   ```
3. Create a pull request to merge to `main` branch
4. Merge the pull request to trigger the production deployment workflow

## 5. Test Full Deployment Flow

### Action Required:
1. After merging to main, monitor the GitHub Actions deployment:
   - Check Actions tab in your GitHub repository
   - Verify the deploy.yml workflow runs successfully
2. Once deployment completes, visit https://thegoanwedding.com
3. Verify the site loads correctly with all functionality

## 6. Test CMS Functionality

### Action Required:
1. Visit https://thegoanwedding.com/admin
2. Log in using your GitHub/Netlify identity provider
3. Create or edit some content
4. Verify:
   - Changes are saved as Git commits
   - New deployment is triggered automatically
   - Changes appear on the live site

## 7. Verify All Functionality

### Action Required:
1. Test all major site features:
   - Navigation between pages
   - Vendor search and filtering
   - Blog post viewing
   - Contact forms
   - Wedding RSVP functionality
   - Admin dashboard access
2. Test on different devices/browsers
3. Verify site performance and loading speed

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If any step fails, check:

### Deployment Issues:
- GitHub Actions logs in your repository's Actions tab
- Cloudflare Pages build logs
- Verify all secrets are correctly configured
- Check branch protection rules

### CMS Issues:
- Verify Git Gateway is enabled in Netlify/Decap CMS
- Check authentication provider settings
- Confirm repository permissions

### Domain Issues:
- Verify DNS settings at your domain registrar
- Check SSL certificate status in Cloudflare
- Confirm domain is properly configured in Cloudflare Pages
