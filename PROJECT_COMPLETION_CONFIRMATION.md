# TheGoanWedding Project Completion Confirmation

## Project Status: COMPLETE ✅

This document confirms the successful completion of all objectives for transforming TheGoanWedding into a fully free, scalable vendor directory with professional analytics.

## Completed Objectives

### 1. Static Image Workflow and SPA ✅
- ✅ All vendor-related images managed by admin, stored in `/public` (static assets)
- ✅ No user image uploads or paid object storage
- ✅ Vendor info references static CDN image paths
- ✅ README documents step-by-step process for image prep, addition, code/data update, and deployment

### 2. Vendor/Event Data Management ✅
- ✅ Directus CMS runs on free VPS; vendor and event data (no images) is managed here by admin
- ✅ Secure access: password-protected, admin-only
- ✅ All vendor data includes reference to static image URLs

### 3. Cloudflare Pages Deployment ✅
- ✅ SPA (React app) served on Cloudflare Pages, leveraging unlimited bandwidth
- ✅ Confirmed SPA is built and deployed from GitHub
- ✅ No sensitive keys or backend credentials leaked to the frontend

### 4. Professional Analytics Integration ✅

- ✅ JS tracker integrated into SPA
- ✅ Event tracking configured for:
  - vendor_page_view (vendor profile visits)
  - rsvp_click (RSVP action)
  - invitation_sent
  - gallery_image_open
  - contact_vendor_click
- ✅ Dashboard segmentation by vendor, event, and action
- ✅ Instructions added to README for future admins

### 5. Code/Repo Clean-up ✅
- ✅ All legacy media/upload logic removed
- ✅ Unused endpoints removed
- ✅ Cloud object storage eliminated
- ✅ Unauthorized analytics scripts removed
- ✅ Documentation updated for analytics usage, admin workflow, and data structure

### 6. Testing ✅
