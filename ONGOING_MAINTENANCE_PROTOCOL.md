# TheGoanWedding - Ongoing Maintenance Protocol

## Maintenance Status: âœ… ACTIVE

This document establishes the ongoing maintenance protocol for TheGoanWedding Vendor Directory and Analytics Platform to ensure stability, security, and continued cost-free operation.

## Current System Architecture Overview

### Zero-Cost Architecture Components
1. **Static SPA**: Deployed on Cloudflare Pages with global CDN

     - Gallery: 1200x800px
   - Compress using tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh
   - Use descriptive filenames in lowercase with hyphens

2. **Directory Setup**:
   ```bash
   mkdir client/public/vendors/{vendor-slug}
   mkdir client/public/vendors/{vendor-slug}/gallery
   ```

3. **Image Placement**:
   - `profile.jpg` - Main vendor profile image
   - `cover.jpg` - Banner/cover image for vendor page
   - Gallery images in the `gallery/` subdirectory

4. **Directus CMS Update**:
   - Access Directus admin panel
   - Navigate to Vendors collection
   - Create vendor record with static image URLs:
     ```json
     {
       "profile_image_url": "/vendors/{vendor-slug}/profile.jpg",
       "cover_image_url": "/vendors/{vendor-slug}/cover.jpg",
       "gallery_image_urls": [
         "/vendors/{vendor-slug}/gallery/image1.jpg",
         "/vendors/{vendor-slug}/gallery/image2.jpg"
       ]
     }
     ```

5. **Deployment**:
   ```bash
   git add client/public/vendors/{vendor-slug}/
   git commit -m "Add images for {vendor-name}"
